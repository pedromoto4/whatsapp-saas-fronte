# PRD: Customer Engagement SaaS MVP

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: Provide a modern, clean interface for WhatsApp Business automation that helps small businesses scale their customer communication effortlessly.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Users can successfully navigate between all main sections
- Authentication flow works smoothly without runtime errors
- API testing interface provides clear feedback on backend connectivity
- Interface feels professional and trustworthy

**Experience Qualities**: Professional, Reliable, Intuitive

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state management)

**Primary User Activity**: Acting and Interacting (managing business communications and settings)

## Core Problem Analysis

The application was experiencing "GITHUB_RUNTIME_PERMANENT_NAME environment variable must be set" errors due to conflicts between Firebase Auth and the GitHub Spark runtime environment. This was resolved by:

1. Removing Firebase Auth dependencies that conflicted with Spark runtime
2. Implementing custom localStorage-based authentication for demo purposes  
3. Maintaining the UI structure while using compatible persistence methods

## Essential Features

### Authentication System
- **Functionality**: Demo login/register with email or Google simulation
- **Purpose**: Allow users to access protected dashboard areas
- **Success Criteria**: Users can log in, stay logged in between sessions, and log out cleanly

### Navigation System
- **Functionality**: Client-side routing between Landing, Login, Pricing, and Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Provide seamless single-page application experience
- **Success Criteria**: All navigation works without page refreshes, URLs update correctly

### Dashboard Interface
- **Functionality**: Multi-section dashboard with overview, automation, catalog, analytics, and API testing
- **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive business management hub
- **Success Criteria**: All sections load quickly, sidebar navigation is intuitive

### API Testing Interface
- **Functionality**: Interactive endpoint testing with visual feedback
- **Purpose**: Allow users to verify backend connectivity and functionality
- **Success Criteria**: Tests show clear success/error states, provide helpful error messages

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with approachable warmth
- **Design Personality**: Clean, modern, slightly playful but trustworthy
- **Visual Metaphors**: Clean cards, subtle shadows, and organized information hierarchy
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal with purposeful visual hierarchy

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Custom warm orange-based palette with purple accents
- **Primary Color**: Warm orange (oklch(0.65 0.30 45)) - energetic and approachable
- **Secondary Colors**: Soft purple (oklch(0.85 0.25 280)) - creative and professional
- **Accent Color**: Fresh green (oklch(0.75 0.28 120)) - success and growth
- **Color Psychology**: Orange conveys enthusiasm and creativity, purple adds professionalism, green reinforces positive outcomes

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Oswald (bold, modern) for headings, system fonts for body text
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between h1-h4, consistent line heights
- **Font Personality**: Clean, approachable, slightly condensed for efficiency
- **Which fonts**: Oswald, Roboto Slab, Space Mono from Google Fonts

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Leveraging shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Input, Badge, etc.)
- **Component States**: All interactive elements have hover, focus, and loading states
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor Icons for consistent visual language
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary buttons use brand color, secondary use outline style

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance maintained throughout
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with visible focus states
- **Error Handling**: Clear, helpful error messages instead of technical details

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Environment Compatibility
- Removed Firebase Auth to prevent Spark runtime conflicts
- Using localStorage-based persistence for authentication state
- Maintained clean separation between authentication logic and UI components

### State Management
- Custom persistent state hooks replace Spark-specific useKV where needed
- React useState for temporary UI state
- localStorage for user session persistence

### API Integration
- Prepared for backend integration with configurable base URL
- Mock authentication tokens for testing purposes
- Comprehensive endpoint testing interface for development

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

- **Runtime Environment**: Application works in both Spark and standard environments
- **Authentication Persistence**: Login state survives page refreshes and browser restarts
- **API Connectivity**: Clear feedback when backend is unavailable
- **Navigation State**: Proper routing protection for authenticated-only areas

## Reflection

This solution prioritizes compatibility and reliability over advanced authentication features. By removing external dependencies that conflict with the runtime environment, we ensure the application works consistently while maintaining the planned user experience. The authentication system can be enhanced with real backend integration later without changing the UI structure.
